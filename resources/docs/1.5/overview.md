Laravel Shopr is a foundation for developers who want to integrate e-commerce into their Laravel application, but don't want to sacrifice the ease or flexibility Laravel provides. 

It allows you to make any model shoppable so you can have full control of your product structure.

Simply put, you get a Cart, Order and Payment solution out of the box with a simple REST API for handling the different shop scenarios.
